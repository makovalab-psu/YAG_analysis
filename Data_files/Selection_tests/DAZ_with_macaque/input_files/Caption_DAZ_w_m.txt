Evolutionary relationships of taxa 
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [1]. The optimal tree is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [2]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [3] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. This analysis involved 58 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated (complete deletion option). There were a total of 731 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [4][5]
